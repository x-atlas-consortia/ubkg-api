# HubMAP OpenAPI Server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) located in the top level directory as [ontology-api-spec.yml](../ontology-api-spec.yml).
The server is created using the [build-server.sh](../build-server.sh) shell script.

A [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection [Ontology.postman_collection.json](./postman/Ontology.postman_collection.json) for accessing/testing the [RestFUL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) endpoints available.
To use it you will need to setup the following Postman Environments:
* ***localhost***: defining **ontology_url** as [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* ***dev***: defining **ontology_url** as [https://ontology-api.dev.hubmapconsortium.org](https://ontology-api.dev.hubmapconsortium.org)

The server uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/).

## Design
The OpenAPI Generator will create the server in **openapi_server**.
All endpoints and Flask related calls are kept in **controllers/default_controller.py**.
Each controller makes one call to a method of the same name found in **managers/neo4j_manager.py**.
In this manner the OpenAPI generated Flask code is separated from the business logic located in the manager.

## New endpoints

To add a new endpoint, update two files:
1. The manager file _neo4j_manager.py in the **openapi_server/managers** path.
2. The __ontology-api-spec.yml__ file, currently at the API root of this repo.
3. Run the generator script (build-server.sh).

The manager and YAML file relate as follows:
1. The endpoint function in the manager file should align with an element in the **paths** section of the YAML. 
2. If the endpoint returns a JSON object, the schema for the object should align with a schema component in the YAML.

Note that generating the new server will remove all calls from the controller to the manager.

## Running Locally
Executing the following script will start the server locally accessing the Neo4J database running in dev.

```
./run_server_on_localhost.py
```

Alternately, the following will rebuild the server and then run it.
```
./build-server.sh -r
```

The server will be available at the URL
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

### neo4j
For run_server_on_localhost.py to work, a local instance of neo4j should be running.
If neo4j is not running, the error message will throw a "connection refused" exception.

## Rebuilding the Docker container (DEV Only)

To get the latest version of the server on the server execute the following:

```bash
# Access the server, switch accounts and go to the server directory
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_e2c.pem <your-login>@ingest.dev.hubmapconsortium.org
$ sudo /bin/su - hive
$ cd /opt/hubmap/ubkg
$ git checkout dev-integrate
$ git pull
```

Then, shut down the server
```bash
$ docker images

Disconnect from the server
```bash
$ exit
logout
[cpk36@ip-172-31-91-142 ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to ingest.dev.hubmapconsortium.org closed.
```

## Setting permissions on the endpoints

The [hubmapconsortium/gateway](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/gateway/) defines the protection on endpoints
for: dev, test, start, and prod. Currently there is no protection set on the endpoints and so they should be marked as follows:
```bash
{
  "ontology-api.dev.hubmapconsortium.org": [
   {
      "method": "GET",
      "endpoint": "/fullCapacityParameterizedTerm/<*>",
      "auth": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Confirm that the server is running and has access to the database

You can do this in two ways. The first is through the postman collection found in the 'server/postman' directory.
The second way is by running a program that accesses the server through an OpenAPI generated interface.
It is this second method that weill be discussed here.

The file './client_programs/terms_term_id_terms.py' was written to test access to the server using the OpenAPI generated interface.
As such the program also was intended to serve as an example of using the OpenAPI generated interface.
In order to use it you will have to have built the server './build_server.sh' using the '-c' optional parameter which will build the client from the openapi spec.
```bash
$ ./build_server.sh -c
```

To run this program you will need to generate an input file consisting of a term to search for.
For a term, you can use something simple like 'cancer'. By default output is sent to stdout. You should see something like the following.
```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ cd client_programs
$ echo 'cancer' > test.txt
$ ./terms_term_id_terms.py test.txt
